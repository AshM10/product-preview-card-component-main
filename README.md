## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Still getting the hang out of using flexbox.
I used to always use bootstrap for grids, and this time I did not use it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
button {
  transition: all 100ms ease-in-out;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more on JavaScript and React projects.
